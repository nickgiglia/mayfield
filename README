# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: First Application

Because I've become a lazy fuck in the last 8 years of my life, I learned Ruby and am now re-doing it because I need a refresher course in my brain.

I've named it after Scott Mayfield, who will hopefully be a wonderful addition to the New York Islanders blueline.

As always, the wonderful RailsTutorial by Michael Hartl is the source.
